--Business Connection as it is currently being called, is an internal social
 -network that expedites communication within businesses by providing employees
 -and administrators with a place to discuss and announce important business information.
 -
 -This is a project I have been working on since the summer of 2013.
 -It is in its infancy to say the least.
 -I will be adding more features and functionality as soon as possible.
 -
 -Some of my future plans for the site include:
 -  
 -  A schedule application that allows each user to create events, 
 -  corporate users will be able to create events that will appear 
 -  on all users schedules such as company wide outings or events.
 -  
 -  More Coporporate Controls
 -    setting up group chats "meetings"
 -    creating company wide events
